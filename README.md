-----------------

eqTrainer is Open-Source Critical Listening Training Application, built with Flutter for Platform-Independency in mind.

<div align="left">

## Features

Inspired by Harman International's free desktop software [How To Listen][H2LLink], eqTrainer aims to bring iconic **Band Identification Task** to various devices - including Mobile!

The **Playlist Feature** and **Built-in Audio Clip Editor** make managing music for your training sessions a breeze.

Thanks to **Multilingual Support**, anyone can train their auditory skills. The Beautiful Design (at least to my eyes) with **Dark Mode** adds to its charm.

## What's better than Previous Legacy Version of eqTrainer?

* Seamless Audio Transition - thanks to Real-Time Audio Filtering

* Responsive UI with Landscape Mode for Devices with Large Display

* Better Optimization and Performance

eqTrainer has been completely re-written to make improvements in a variety of areas, including those three major changes mentioned above.

### macOS

eqTrainer would work on macOS with Apple Silicon Mac, but I haven't tested it yet.
If you have an Apple Silicon Mac, try building it.

Unfortunately, the Audio Backend of eqTrainer does not support x86-based Intel Mac for now.

### Windows

Since Original 'How to Listen' from Harman International is working fine on Windows, adding Windows support to eqTrainer is low on priorty as for now.
