-----------------

eqTrainer is Open-Source Critical Listening Training Application, built with Flutter for Platform-Independence in mind.

<div align="left">

## Features

Inspired by Harman International's free desktop software [How To Listen][H2LLink], eqTrainer aims to bring iconic **Band Identification Task** to various devices - including Mobile!

The **Playlist Feature** and **Built-in Audio Clip Editor** make managing music for your training sessions a breeze.

Thanks to **Multilingual Support**, anyone can train their auditory skills. The Beautiful Design (at least to my eyes) with **Dark Mode** adds to its charm.
