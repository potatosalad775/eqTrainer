-----------------

eqTrainer is Open-Source Critical Listening Training Application, built with Flutter for Platform-Independency in mind.

<div align="left">

## Features

Inspired by Harman International's free desktop software [How To Listen][H2LLink], eqTrainer aims to bring iconic **Band Identification Task** to various devices - including Mobile!

The **Playlist Feature** and **Built-in Audio Clip Editor** make managing music for your training sessions a breeze.

Thanks to **Multilingual Support**, anyone can train their auditory skills. The Beautiful Design (at least to my eyes) with **Dark Mode** adds to its charm.

## What's better than Previous Legacy Version of eqTrainer?

* Seamless Audio Transition - thanks to Real-Time Audio Filtering

* Responsive UI with Landscape Mode for Devices with Large Display

* Better Optimization and Performance

eqTrainer has been completely re-written to make improvements in a variety of areas, including those three major changes mentioned above.

## Supported Platform & Download

### Android

eqTrainer is currently under publication pending status on Google Play Store.

You can directly download APK file from [Release Tab](https://github.com/potatosalad775/eq_trainer/releases/latest) as of now.

### iOS & MacOS

Since eqTrainer is built upon Flutter Framework, technically it could be expanded to Apple Devices, and I'm really looking forward to it.

However, Support for those two platforms are currently not available for now. If you're familiar with Flutter and Apple Ecosystem, please feel free to contribute to the project!

### Windows

Since Original 'How to Listen' from Harman International is working fine on Windows, adding Windows support to eqTrainer is low on priorty as for now.

## Localization

eqTrainer is built with Localization in mind, and you can easily contribute to this project by translating it!

If you want to translate this project, please refer to [Localization Wiki page](https://github.com/potatosalad775/eq_trainer/wiki/Localization).

If you like this project, please consider donating! It will help me purchase an used Mac to add support for iOS and MacOS.
