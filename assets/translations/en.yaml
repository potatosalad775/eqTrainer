    "Humans hear sound by perceiving vibrations in the air with the eardrums. The pitch of the sound is determined only by the speed of the vibrations.
    \n\nHere, frequency means the number of vibrations in one second, so a lower frequency (slower vibration) results in a lower note, and a higher frequency (faster vibration) results in a higher note.",
  "HELP_SUB_FREQ_P1_PARAGRAPH_2":
    "Hz is the unit for frequency, and eqTrainer uses the SI prefix 'Kilo' to represent 1000 units of frequency, so 1000Hz is represented as 1kHz.

  ## Goal of 'eqTrainer'
  "HELP_SUB_GOAL_TITLE": "Goal of 'eqTrainer'",
  ## - Page 1
  "HELP_SUB_GOAL_P1_PARAGRAPH_1":
    "'eqTrainer' was heavily inspired by 'How To Listen', a hearing skill training program from Harman International - the company that owns JBL, AKG and many other brands.
    \n'eqTrainer' provides 'Band Identification' among the training features provided by 'How To Listen'.
    \n\n'Band Identification' is performed by alternately listening to a 'sound source with an equalizer' that changes the sound around a randomly assigned frequency,
    and the 'original sound source' without any modulation. The goal is to accurately determine which frequency range has been modulated and how.
    \n\nLike 'How To Listen', which was developed as a training program for audio product R&D team, 'eqTrainer' was developed to train users in critical listening skills.",
  "HELP_SUB_GOAL_P1_PARAGRAPH_2":
    "There is some debate as to whether or not there is a need to develop critical listening skills at the amateur hobbyist level, not audio engineers,
    but I personally believe that it is beneficial for the average listener in two ways: to better utilize an equalizer, and to better make relative comparisons between Frequency Response measurements.",

    \n\nPress the + button at the bottom right corner of the playlist screen to select a music file. At this time, if a selected file is not in 'mp3, wav, or flac' format - which is supported by 'eqTrainer', it will be converted to flac format.",
  "HELP_SUB_PLAYLIST_P1_PARAGRAPH_2":
    "Once the song has been loaded, you will be in the editor screen as shown above. If you want to cut out a portion of the song, move the slider or play the song to the point where you want to cut it,
    and You can set the start point or end point of the song by pressing the 'Set Start Now' or 'Set End Now' button.
    \n\nThe start and end points of these cut 'audio clips' are indicated by arrows and times. When you're done, press the 'Done' button and the 'audio clip' will be added to your playlist.",

  ## Configuring Session

  "HELP_SUB_CONFIG_P1_PARAGRAPH":
    "Each training session is conducted by the user alternately listening to a modified audio or an original audio, and determining which frequency range has changed.
    \n\nTo make it easier for the user to select the desired range during this process, eqTrainer provide visualised frequency information via a 'frequency graph' like the one pictured above.
    \n\nBefore starting a training session, users can personalise the difficulty or progression of the session to their liking by adjusting the items below on the 'Configure Session' page.",
  "HELP_SUB_CONFIG_P1_SB": "* Starting Band",
  "HELP_SUB_CONFIG_P1_SB_DESC":
    "The 'Start Frequency Band' determines how many 'centre frequencies' the filter can be applied to when the session starts.

  "HELP_SUB_CONFIG_P1_G": "* Gain",
  "HELP_SUB_CONFIG_P1_G_DESC":

  "HELP_SUB_CONFIG_P1_TYPE": "* Filter Type",
  "HELP_SUB_CONFIG_P1_TYPE_DESC":
    "The 'Filter Type' determines the appearance of the filter applied to the sound source.
    \nA 'peak' is represented by a raised graph, which 'emphasises' sounds of a certain frequency. 'Dips', on the other hand, are represented by a dipped graph, which 'dampens' certain frequencies of sound.
    \nYou can also set it up so that both 'peak' and 'dip' filters appear, as shown in the photo.",
  "HELP_SUB_CONFIG_P1_THR": "* Threshold",
  "HELP_SUB_CONFIG_P1_THR_DESC":
    "The 'threshold' is used as a baseline for adjusting the difficulty based on the user's skill. The 'eqTrainer' keeps a record of whether the user has correctly identified the modulated frequency range,
    and If the number of times reaches the 'threshold', it self-adjusts the difficulty by increasing or decreasing the number of centre frequencies used for the filter.",
